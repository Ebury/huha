huha.js (Hyperactive Users Hint Analysis) is a JavaScript 
framework that measures the usability and user experience
in an automated way, including the limitations of the 
model and the best practices.

## Documentation ##

For Adding huha.js to your web application, just include the following script.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ebury-huha.s3.amazonaws.com/1.0.0/huha.js"></script>
```

TODO. In the meantime, take a look at the source code as it contains plenty of comments.


## Our story ##

We thought we had to honour the great Chimo Bayo, 
we’ve programmed this while listenting all his hits 
“asi me gusta” and the must-listen “techno valencia”, 
then we thought what if a user interacts with our app 
while listenting Chimo Bayo? Bang! There you have your
Hyperactive User and here we have our Hint Analytics. 
It makes totally sense for us.
